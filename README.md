# Tutorial on collaboration models in GitHub

This is a repo for practicing git collaboration models. Feel free to contribute (read the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)).

## Prerequisites

* You have some basic experience using using Git and GitHub and are familiar familiar with concepts like: clone, push, pull, checkout, commit, branch, fork.
* DataCamp’s [Introduction to Git](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git-for-data-science) free course is good for beginners and also a good review of the basic commands if you feel like you need a refresher.

## Types of collaborative development models

From GitHub's [documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-collaborative-development-models/):

* In the **shared repository model**: "collaborators are granted push access to a single shared repository and topic branches are created when changes need to be made."
  * This model is popular with organizations collaborating on private projects
* In the **fork and pull model**: "anyone can fork an existing repository and push changes to their personal fork without needing access to the source repository. The changes can be pulled into the source repository by the project maintainer."
  * This model is popular with open source projects
  
## Workflow

This tutorial will focus on the second type of model, with the aim of giving an introduction to how to contribute to open-source projects.

The basic idea is the following:
* Fork the project
* Make changes
* Perform a pull request

### Step-by-step

## Let's practice!

### Premise

* This public GitHub repository contains list Star Wars characters. We have one file per character, and it contains the name and a short description of the character.
* I am looking for other people to contribute to my Star Wars characters project. (Yes, I could have written a script to get the full list of characters, but that is not the point...)
* You don’t have *push* access to my repository, so you will have to create a Pull Request.

### Task

* Contribute to this project by adding one Star Wars character that is currently not in the repo.

*Hint*: you can find a long list of Star Wars characters on [Wikipedia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_characters)

### A bit of help

In case you get stuck on the task or your pull request is rejected:

* Follow the CONTRIBUTING.md file in the repo
* Ensure that there isn’t already a pull request or issue reported that handles your intention of contribution
